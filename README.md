  It's an anonymous communication application for teenagers.
  </h3>
</div>

## OVERVIEW
"POINTER" is a community service with a voting system. People can create virtual space with their members. Anyone in their space could enroll a question to be voted.
Each member of the room votes anonymously depending on their opinion. In other words, the user virtually points to the person who fits the question well. Smooth communication within the same group is very important. This is because it is very advantageous in forming rapport, which is related to unity. However, there is no popularized community for 'teens' who value the sense of belonging. "POINTER" enables teens to form good relationships with their friends and enhance engagement.
